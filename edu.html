                <img class="owners" src="./images/edu6.jpg" /> As a small and strongly community rooted 
                organization in a region, we focus on initiatives that foster health, justice and food and 
                energy resiliency in our own region, which has both tremendous economic and health needs and
                great potential to survive and thrive.

            <p>Grow Food Everywhere</p>
            <p class="par"><img class="owners" src="./images/edu3.jpg" />Our Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice program 
            that provides gardens to families and childcare centers in need of, and unable to afford fresh food, and 
            wellness gardens at central community locations.</p>
            <p>School Gardens</p>
            <p class="par"><img class="owners" src="./images/edu2.jpg" />We have a long and vibrant history of helping schools 
            establish school gardens locally and throughout the Northeast.  School gardens are a wonderful way to engage
            students in developing life-long skills for food resiliency, health, and healing through connecting to the 
            earth and each other.  School gardens and composting programs are an exciting element of the growing “Farm to 
            School” movement.  Curricular connections and opportunities for service learning abound!</p>
