                <img class="owners" src="./images/gfe1.jpg" />In 2003-2006 there were gardens at 7 
                schools and at the Athol Memorial Hospital, then in 2011 we launched our Grow Food Everywhere for 
                Health and Justice initiative. In 2012  we added gardens at the Orange Innovation Center, 
                a converted factory, cared for by tenants and master gardener Pat Conrad, who brings food to 
                the Orange Food Pantry. In addition, by the end of 2012, twenty low-income families received 
                raised beds abundant with salad greens, tomatoes, cukes and beans. Then we created gardens at 
                the local public library, the North Quabbin Community Co-op, and the Orange Food Pantry.
                A garden creation begins with the arrival of community resources: locally milled lumber, a truck 
                filled with rich soil from Clearview Compost, and a crew of enthusiastic Seeds of Solidarity staff 
                and sometimes volunteers.

            <p>
                “I’m diabetic, my 14 year old son is pre-diabetic, and my 
                9 year old daughter is gluten free…being able to provide a variety of fresh vegetables to both my children
                is not only a benefit financially but helps me meet my personal goal of opening the door to the wonderful 
                world of fresh, clean foods to my children.”
            </p>
            <p>“I don’t have the money to buy fresh foods…a great benefit of the garden is having fresh foods for my 
            children that are not filled with chemicals from mass producers.”
            </p>
            <p>“Patients were really thrilled to have the opportunity to pick their vegetables right after seeing a doctor
            or nutritionist. I’d often take them out to the gardens with a bag, and off they’d go. We have a lot of folks 
            with great need and they were very happy to be able to get some extra food…and I was happy to be able to give 
            them vegetables rather than pop-tarts.”Mary Sieruta MS, Registered Dietician, Community Health Center of Franklin County
