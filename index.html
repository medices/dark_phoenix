        <hr class="line"/>
        <p>Seeds of Solidarity consists of  two entities that are fiscally distinct, but connected by land, spirit and vision: Seeds of 
        Solidarity Farm, and Seeds of Solidarity Education Center Inc.
        The Seeds of Solidarity 30 acre site is located on Chestnut Hill Road in Orange, Massachusetts, one of nine towns in the 
        North Quabbin region. The Quabbin Reservoir was created in the late 1930’s as a water supply for Boston. The flooding of 
        four towns and a fertile valley took much of the region’s agricultural land out of production. When the mills began to close,
        economic depression was left in the wake. Through the transformation of abandoned land into a bountiful farm, working with neighbors
        to initiate a flourishing festival, and establishing innovative education programs, Seeds of Solidarity is helping to revitalize the region.

        <hr class="line" />
        <p class="through">Through our Grow Food Everywhere for Health and Justice initiative we initially created gardens at the homes of families facing hunger 
        as well as throughout the community. But joblessness, landlord problems or domestic violence sometimes meant they had to leave their homes… 
        and gardens. Simultaneously, we realized that there were many women in our community who ran family childcare programs at their homes, and 
        that these providers could reach 10-12 children and their families-many in need of nourishment in all forms- through one garden. And, they 
        had the enthusiasm and flexibility to integrate garden learning into the day, and to use their fresh harvest for snacks and lunches. Over the 
        past two years, this program has blossomed a supportive and enthusiastic network of family childcare providers, inspired many young children 
        to grow, prepare and enjoy healthy vegetables, increase physical activity, cultivate connection to nature, and extend fresh joy to their families.</p>
